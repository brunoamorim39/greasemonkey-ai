## ðŸ“± Next Steps for Full Integration

### 1. Add Document Sources to Chat Bubbles

In your `main_screen.dart` or wherever you display chat responses, add:

```dart
import 'screens/widgets/document_sources_widget.dart';

// In your chat bubble widget:
Column(
  children: [
    Text(response['answer']), // Your existing response text

    // Add this for document sources:
    if (response['sources'] != null && response['sources'].isNotEmpty)
      DocumentSourcesWidget(
        sources: (response['sources'] as List)
          .map((s) => DocumentSource(
            title: s['title'],
            type: DocumentType.fromString(s['type']),
            relevanceScore: s['relevance_score'],
            snippet: s['snippet'],
          ))
          .toList(),
        isExpanded: false,
        onToggle: () {
          // Handle expand/collapse
        },
      ),
  ],
)
```

### 2. Add Upload Prompts (Optional)

For users who haven't uploaded documents:

```dart
// After a response with no sources:
if (response['sources'] == null || response['sources'].isEmpty)
  NoSourcesPromptWidget(
    onUploadPressed: () {
      Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const DocumentUploadScreen(),
      ));
    },
  ),
```

### 3. Add Required Dependencies

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  file_picker: ^5.5.0  # For PDF file selection
  # Your existing dependencies...
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### **Data Flow**:
1. User asks question in chat
2. Question + user context sent to `/ask` endpoint
3. Backend automatically searches user documents + system manuals
4. GPT gets contextual information from relevant documents
5. Response includes answer + source attribution
6. Flutter app displays response with source chips

### **Storage Management**:
- **Free users**: 0MB upload limit, can view system manuals only
- **Paid users**: 1GB upload limit with usage tracking
- **Real-time limits**: Enforced on upload with user-friendly messages

### **Document Processing**:
- PDFs processed server-side with text extraction
- Chunked and stored in vector database for semantic search
- Car-specific filtering by make/model/year
- Status tracking: Processing â†’ Ready â†’ Available for search

## ðŸ’¡ User Experience Benefits

### **For Car Mechanics**:
- Upload their own shop manuals and guides
- Get answers backed by their specific documentation
- See exactly where information comes from
- Seamless integration with existing chat workflow

### **For Car Enthusiasts**:
- Access to professional Bentley/Haynes manuals
- Upload aftermarket guides and DIY documentation
- Share knowledge with community (public documents)
- Build personal knowledge library

### **For All Users**:
- More accurate, source-backed responses
- Reduced liability through transparency
- Contextual answers specific to their vehicle
- Professional manual integration without extra cost
