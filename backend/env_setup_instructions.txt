INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIXING OPENAI API AUTHENTICATION
==============================================

You need to add these lines to your backend/.env file:

OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=your-org-id-here
OPENAI_PROJECT=your-project-id-here

To find these values:
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization
2. Copy your Organization ID (starts with "org-")
3. Go to https://platform.openai.com/settings/proj
4. Copy your Project ID (starts with "proj_")

Example .env additions:
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=org-abc123def456
OPENAI_PROJECT=proj_xyz789uvw123

After adding these, restart the backend:
make stop-backend
make run-backend

The new sk-proj- API keys require these headers for authentication.
